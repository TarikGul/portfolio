                    amazing life because of my parents. I was involved in a ton of mathematics, and robotics, while maintaining a balanced life of soccer, bmx dirt jumping, and <br/>
                    snowboarding. When I was 18 I moved out to San Francisco with at the time my highschool sweetheart. San Francisco has always had a place in my heard since i was 5. <br/>
